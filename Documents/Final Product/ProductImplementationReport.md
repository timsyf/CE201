Authentication System
Data Structures
The authentication component relies on the User table in the database. This table has fields for id, name, role, password_hash, and department_id. The structure is essentially a relational table in an SQL database, optimized for efficient data retrieval and integrity.

User Table: Stores user credentials and roles. The password_hash field uses bcrypt for secure password storage. The table is indexed by the id field for fast lookup.
Algorithm
The authentication process consists of two main steps: password verification and session creation.

Password Verification: Upon login attempt, the system retrieves the user's password_hash based on the provided username. It then uses the bcrypt algorithm (via check_password_hash) to verify the submitted password against the stored hash.

Session Creation: If the password verification is successful, a session is created, storing essential user information like user_id, user_role, and department_id for access control throughout the user's session.

Time Complexity: O(1) for password verification due to direct access through the id or username. Bcrypt's time complexity is adjustable and designed to be computationally intensive to resist brute-force attacks.
Space Complexity: Primarily depends on the number of users. Each user's data storage is constant, leading to O(n) space complexity, where n is the number of users.
Department Information Management
Data Structures
This feature utilizes two main tables: Department and DepartmentHR.

Department Table: Stores department details, including id, name, default_total_hours, core_skills_percentage, and soft_skills_percentage. It's structured for straightforward department management.

DepartmentHR Table: Manages the many-to-many relationships between HR officers and departments, indicating which departments each HR officer can manage.

Algorithm
Managing department assignments for HR officers involves inserting or updating records in the DepartmentHR table to reflect the relationships between HR officers and departments.

Assignment Update: The algorithm checks for an existing assignment between an HR officer and a department. If none exists, it creates a new record. If an update is required, it modifies the existing record.

Time Complexity: The operation's time complexity is O(log n) for insertion and searching, assuming the database uses efficient indexing. If no indexing is used, the complexity could degrade to O(n).

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of HR officer and department assignments. Each record's size is constant, but the total space required grows linearly with the number of assignments.
