# Team Implementation Report
*This section should describe the technical details of your implementation.  The subheadings and italicised text below may be used to guide you.*

## Technical Diagrams
*Include a class diagram / circuit diagram, and/or any other relevant technical diagrams.*

## Technical Description
*This section should describe the software implementation in prose form.  Focus on how the code was designed and built.* 
*It should make a clear description that could be used by any future developers to maintain and extend your code, if necessary.*
*Describe important functions / classes / class hierarchies.*
*In this section, you should also wish to highlight any technical achievements your team is particularly proud of, including relevant code snippets.*

## Algorithms and Data Structures
*Describe datastructures of at least one component of your implementation.*
*Describe at least one algorithm used in your implementation.*
*In both cases, describe the space / time complexity of each.*

## Imported Libraries 
*List any 3rd party libraries that were used and describe what functionality they provided.*

## Known Issues
*List any known issues (bugs) in your software, and describe workarounds if they exist.*
