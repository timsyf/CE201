# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion

*Include a paragraph or two, agreed by all team members, on how well the group has worked together, and how well the project is progressing.*

*Discuss the scrum meetings, and what could make them more efficient (if anything).*

*Highlight any communication issues that might be affecting the project.*

*If standup meetings were used, then include a Jira link, and discuss their effectiveness.*

## Sprint Burndown Charts

*In this section include a screenshot of a sprint-burndown chart for each of your completed sprints.*

*For each sprint, include links to the standup meetings (recorded on Jira, hopefully) associated with each sprint.*

## Burndown-Charts Discussion
*Add a discussion of what the burndown charts indicate, and how your team might improve their velocity / estimation ability in future sprints.*

## Product Backlog
*Include here a screenshot of your current product backlog.*

## Other Areas
*If your team has anything else they want to demonstrate, e.g. advanced project management tools, reporting graphs with suitable explanation and interpretation, advanced use of Jira (e.g. issue links, epics, versions), or continuous integration tools, then include a summary here.*
